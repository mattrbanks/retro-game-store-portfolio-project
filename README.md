## Matt's Retro Games

I had a lot of fun with this project because these are many of my favorite retro games. This is like a tribute to games that I am nostalgic for but in the form of a retro game store. I used a real price guide to price each game so they should be very accurately priced in my store. This store template has all the hallmarks of an e-commerce website and it utilizes a sandbox PayPal that can be activated in the future to handle real transactions. I won't be parting with my collection though.

### Technologies Used

- React

- Javascript

- Bootstrap

- Styled components

- PayPal

- React router

### PayPal

The PayPalButton component renders PayPal's express check out button. In this case it is a sandbox PayPal environment which can give receipts for fake purchases through a testing sandbox account on https://developer.paypal.com/home/ but the account can be made live at any time by switching the sandbox client id for a production client id.

### Store Features

- Search bar to find games and consoles faster

- Game product pages for Sega, Nintendo, and Playstation retro games

- A list of retro consoles on the landing page

- Detail page for each product you click

- Multiple ways to add items to the cart

- Cart checkout with tax (USA) and ability to buy multiple copies of one product, clear cart, or delete one item at a time

- Easy navigation
